grolprep is a web application for studying the FCC GROL questions in preparation of taking the exams.

The study of this multiple-choice data is in the flash-card style. Students can choose from Elements 1, 3 and 8 and can specify any subelement of those three for specific study. Questions and answers can be randomly presented.

Additionally, simulations of the randomly-chosen exams can be practiced with this software.

grolprep will shortly be used by students of Avionics program at the Burlington Aviation Technology School.
