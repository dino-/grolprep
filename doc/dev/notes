There is a tool to regenerate the sqlite database in resources/ from the source text files in util/resources/ :

   bin/db-regen.sh

The randomly chosen simulations of real tests are to be generated like this:

there are three different tests that need to be generated
Elements 1, 3 and 8

File  1.txt  needs 24 of 170

That will become one 24 question test - Element 1


File 3a.txt needs  3  of   40
File 3b.txt needs  3  of   42
File 3c.txt needs  6  of   69
File 3d.txt needs 17  of  202
File 3e.txt needs 10  of  150
File 3f.txt needs 17  of  139
File 3g.txt needs 10  of  131
File 3h.txt needs 10  of  143

That will become one 76 question test - Element 3


File 8.txt  needs 50  of  321

That will become one 50 question test - Element 8

2009-09-04 Information about the new questions scheduling:

For the FCC testing, as you know, they are switching to the new test
question pools. There are two ways that someone can take an FCC exam.
They can go to a designated FCC examiner (they are all over the country)
or they can go to a computer test center (CATS or LASERGRADE) to take the
exam. We are a CATS testing center.

If the person goes to a designated examiner, the examiner has the option
to use the current test pools or use the new test pools. As of December
25, 2009 they will only be able to use the new test pools.

For us being a CATS test center, the rules are different. The CATS system
will continue using only the old test pools until December 25, 2009 and
then switch to the new test pools.

Developer configuration

This web application requires access to its data files to function. The easiest way to work on it is to configure it with a --prefix to a dir in your http server document root.

Changes made require both build and install, don't forget install or nothing will be deployed to where the web server is looking.
