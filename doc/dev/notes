2009-09-04 Information about the new questions scheduling:

For the FCC testing, as you know, they are switching to the new test
question pools. There are two ways that someone can take an FCC exam.
They can go to a designated FCC examiner (they are all over the country)
or they can go to a computer test center (CATS or LASERGRADE) to take the
exam. We are a CATS testing center.

If the person goes to a designated examiner, the examiner has the option
to use the current test pools or use the new test pools. As of December
25, 2009 they will only be able to use the new test pools.

For us being a CATS test center, the rules are different. The CATS system
will continue using only the old test pools until December 25, 2009 and
then switch to the new test pools.

Developer configuration

This web application requires access to its data files to function. The easiest way to work on it is to configure it with a --prefix to a dir in your http server document root.

Changes made require both build and install, don't forget install or nothing will be deployed to where the web server is looking.

   /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
