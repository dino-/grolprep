- Original Perl version uses a pair of maps to point answer numbers to letters and back. These are set up randomly, but the two-way lookup is needed.

   In Haskell, we can use Data.Bimap


   data Answers = Answers
      Int      -- Index of correct answer
      [String] -- List of answer texts

   data Question = Question
      Int      -- Question number
      String   -- Question text
      Answers

Or should it be:

   data Question = Question
      String   -- Question text
      Answers

   type Questions = Map Int Question
   -- Where Int is the question number

Question index comes from the nnn]  part

During parse, easier to have each answer be a (String, Bool) and then turn that [(String, Bool)] into an Answers with the one True one's index.
