beta

- Add correct/incorrect info to the answer results page

- Add running stats to each question display

- Change the session and code to do the passes style of study

- Add the randomization machinery

- Need a real conf file to set things like logging, etc

- Include newer elements 1, 3 and 8. This will involve changes to the data parsing.
  Will probably want to parse data into our own format and store it as serialized Haskell data.

- Stop calling the project fequiz2, name the directory fequiz-web for now?


-----
release

- Add an end of test results page

- Need to set the cookie expiration time, let's say a week

- Fill out missing cabal info

- Work on the styles to make everything look and work better

- Need a feedback form for reporting problems. Have this do something simple at first, append data to a file on the server.

- More explanatory information on the start page. Maybe links to the VT aviation site and also the FCC?


-----
feature additions

- Should I now support the questions with images?

- Add elements 2, 4, 5... that are not used by the VT aviation people at all, but may be useful to the general population


-----
general TODO thoughts

- What about special http server configuration? Maybe a script in util. At the very least, should document this better in the README or something.
  Apache conf: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  DocumentRoot: /srv/http/
