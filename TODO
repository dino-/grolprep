beta

- Make the footer into a header, discuss the layout some more

- Make the SessionId code gracefully deal with IPv6 ::1 addresses. Just a dirty pattern match on that address is fine for now.

- Deal with the start form submit with no questions selected at all. Make it go right back to initialize.

- Create a web page for this project at ui3.info to describe what it's all about and provide links to the source, darcs commands, and more

- Add this project to the resume. Make it start working for you.

- Add the test simulation mode that randomly picks the 100 questions

- Need a real conf file to set things like logging, etc

- Add an end of test results page


-----
release

- Need to set the cookie expiration time, let's say a week

- Fill out missing cabal info

- Work on the styles to make everything look and work better

- Need a feedback form for reporting problems. Have this do something simple at first, append data to a file on the server.

- More explanatory information on the start page. Maybe links to the VT aviation site and also the FCC?

- Generate a statically linked binary


-----
feature additions

- Could the session data be stored on Amazon S3? How about the question data? Think about it.

- Support the questions with images, there are a couple.

- Add elements 2, 4, 5... that are not used by the VT aviation people at all, but may be useful to the general population


-----
general TODO thoughts

- What about special http server configuration? Maybe a script in util.

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
