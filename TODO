beta

- Fequiz.Common.Log.formattedDate commented out and not deleted

- fequiz.hs dispatchStudy mbSession only really needs to be a Bool
   do this: haveSess = liftM (maybe False (const True)) getSession

- Reexport System.Log in Fequiz.Common.Log so we don't have to explicitly import it to get the Priority type

- Fequiz.Web.Study: clean up some putSession code to be one line

- Put in some SQL error handling

- May be possible to use Database.HDBC.quickQuery' in some places

- Be smarter about installation directory permissions. Tricky, this is distro-specific.

- Need a feedback form for reporting problems. Have this do something simple at first, store data in a file on the server.

- Create a web page for this project at ui3.info to describe what it's all about and provide links to the source, darcs commands, and more

- Add this project to the resume. Make it start working for you.

- Add the test simulation mode that randomly picks the 100 questions

- Need a real conf file to set things like logging, etc

- Add an end of test results page


-----
release

- Need to set the cookie expiration time, let's say a week

- Fill out missing cabal info

- Work on the styles to make everything look and work better

- More explanatory information on the start page. Maybe links to the VT aviation site and also the FCC?

- Generate a statically linked binary


-----
feature additions

- Add IPv6 support to the SessionId code. It will fail now to compute a session id.

- Could the session data be stored on Amazon S3? How about the question data? Think about it.

- Support the questions with images, there are a couple.

- Add elements 2, 4, 5... that are not used by the VT aviation people at all, but may be useful to the general population


-----
general TODO thoughts

- What about special http server configuration? Maybe a script in util.

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
