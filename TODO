bugs

- figures missing for problems 3-43f6 and 3-47f2, figures 3f15 and 3f16

- problem 3-35e5: B is marked as correct answer but it's really A


-----
release

- SEO
   - Use <h?> tags in static pages
   - site index document when we know what domain it's going to be on

- Start using fastcgi or maybe scgi

- Put in some SQL error handling

- Consolidate stats and summary code, the math code could be shared


-----
feature additions

- Add something to the state about the type of study that's being performed. Simulation or "normal" study. So that we can display it with each question.

- Would be terrific if we could allow feedback at any time during study and go back to where we came from without error

- Add IPv6 support to the SessionId code. It will fail now to compute a session id so we have an ugly hack looking for ::1 specifically.

- Split front page up into a new information-rich front page that then links to the setup form page

- Figure out how and what we can save in the custom list of problem IDs on the setup form. At a minimum we can have another cheap session for the browser being used that remembers what you've done recently. That's without getting into user accounts yet.

general TODO thoughts

- I'd like to clean up some of the xhtml-producing code in Study

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
