release

- SEO
   - Use <h?> tags in static pages
   - site index document when we know what domain it's going to be on

- Work on the feedback page Cancel button style, looks different than the submit button in IE

- Start using fastcgi or maybe scgi

- Grolprep.Web.Study.getProblemMetaInfo should use a join instead of the 4 selects

- Put in some SQL error handling

- Consolidate stats and summary code, the math code could be shared

- Change Next Prob button on summary when at end of session


-----
feature additions

- Add something to the state about the type of study that's being performed. Simulation or "normal" study. So that we can display it with each question.

- Would be terrific if we could allow feedback at any time during study and go back to where we came from without error

- Add IPv6 support to the SessionId code. It will fail now to compute a session id so we have an ugly hack looking for ::1 specifically.

- Split front page up into a new information-rich front page that then links to the setup form page


-----
general TODO thoughts

- I'd like to clean up some of the xhtml-producing code in Study

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
