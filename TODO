release

- Start using fastcgi

- May need to add something to the state about the type of study that's being performed. Simulation or "normal" study. So that we can display it with each question.

- Put in some SQL error handling

- Need to set the cookie expiration time, let's say a week

- Work on the styles to make everything look and work better

- More explanatory information on the start page. Maybe links to the VT aviation site and also the FCC?

- Add an end of test results page

- Generate a statically linked binary


-----
feature additions

- Developer feature (turned on with a conf switch) to be able to specifically make a test of one or very few questions using question id in the start form. Wait on this until we get more feedback about that form.

- Add IPv6 support to the SessionId code. It will fail now to compute a session id.

- Support the questions with images, there are many


-----
general TODO thoughts

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
