beta

- Put test type, element, subelement and keytopic full info on each problem page. Both pose and answer.

- Switch everything to use url patterns like /feedback does already. At the moment, this means the study section.

- Feedback needs to continue on to something, like a post-feedback page, that will then go back to where it came from. Is this doable?

- Create a web page for this project at ui3.info to describe what it's all about and provide links to the source, darcs commands, and more

- Add this project to the resume. Make it start working for you.

- Add an end of test results page


-----
release

- Put in some SQL error handling

- Need to set the cookie expiration time, let's say a week

- Fill out missing cabal info

- Work on the styles to make everything look and work better

- More explanatory information on the start page. Maybe links to the VT aviation site and also the FCC?

- Generate a statically linked binary


-----
feature additions

- Add IPv6 support to the SessionId code. It will fail now to compute a session id.

- Could the session data be stored on Amazon S3? How about the question data? Think about it.

- Support the questions with images, there are a couple.

- Add elements 2, 4, 5... that are not used by the VT aviation people at all, but may be useful to the general population


-----
general TODO thoughts

- What about special http server configuration? Maybe a script in util.

- May want to read that old old page about avoiding SQL injection attacks with Haskell. Track it down.
