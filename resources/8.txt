b)  E and I are in phase on a flat line.

c)  Standing waves travel down the line.@@

d)  Reflected waves travel toward the source.


319]  Standing waves on a transmission line may be an indication
that:

320]  What is the purpose or function of the RADAR
duplexer/circulator?

a)  A coupling device that is used in the transition from a
rectangular waveguide to a circular waveguide.

b)  An electronic switch that allows the use of one antenna for
both transmission and reception.@@

c)  A modified length of waveguide that is used to sample a
portion of the transmitted energy for testing purposes. 

d)  A dual section coupling device that allows the use of a
magnetron as a transmitter.
